My name is Sisco and I'm a passionate horse breeder/ entrepreneur who loves to meet people and travel the world. I'm originally from Menorca, a small island in Spain and live in the Netherlands since 1993. Over the past 25 years+ I've been managing a vacation park in the Netherlands together with my wife Jannette, and have been hosting thousands of travelers from all over the world in our holiday park. I really enjoy getting to know our guests, finding out what they'd like to see and experience in the Netherlands and giving that piece of advice that helps our guests experience the surroundings and the Netherlands in a way they didn't expect. I'm a fanatic sporter and run very often in the forest around our Holiday park. Before booking with us, make sure to read the reviews of our previous Guests and please feel free to contact me if you have any question about my listings.
Hope to see you soon,
